    "At times, you'll need to express the mathematics behind some idea or code. [Donald Kunth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), a famous computer scientist, developed a system called [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) to typeset mathematics to publish a series of books. This system was later extended to produce [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), which was somewhat easier to use.\n",

    "The TeX / LaTeX notation has been widely adopted to typeset mathematics on the web. The same notation is used in [Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Using_TeX_Notation), [Jupyter notebooks](http://data-blog.udacity.com/posts/2016/10/latex-primer/) and [Piazza](http://support.piazza.com/customer/portal/articles/1775067-latex-equation-editor) -- pretty much every tool we'll use. TeX notation [can also be used for web pages through the MathJaX standard](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html), \n",
